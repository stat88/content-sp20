    "\n",
    "- Go to lecture and sections, and also go over the relevant text sections and discussion sections before starting on the homework. You should not expect to simply remember all the ideas and details from what you heard in class.\n",
    "- Attempt the homework problems by yourself with the text and section work at hand. The step above will help this step go faster and be more fruitful.\n",
    "- At this point, seek help if you need it. Don't ask how to do the problem â€” ask how to get started, or explain where you are stuck and ask for a nudge to get you past that point.\n",
    "- For a good measure of your understanding, keep track of the fraction of the homework you can do by yourself or with minimal help. It's a better measure than your homework score, and only you can measure it.\n",
    "- **Show all work. Give reasoning. The question isn't always going to ask for it, because we assume that you will provide justification for your answers. Calculations are fine as justifications, as are diagrams that are clearly labeled to show what's going on.**\n",
    "- **Draw lots of diagrams. They are really helpful, as in this homework where a Venn diagram or two might save you a headache or two.**"

It's well worth reading and has some illuminating graphics. In this exercise you will confirm a result stated in the article. Useful terminology:\n",

The article says, \"The sensitivity of routine screening mammography ranges from 71% to 96% and the specificity ranges from 94% to 97%. Using values of 80% for sensitivity and 96% for specificity, a positive test increases the probability to 17%.\"\n",
